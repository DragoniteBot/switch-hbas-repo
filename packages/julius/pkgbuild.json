        "details": "NOTE: This app requires files to be copied over from a legally obtained version of the original game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/517790/Caesar_3/\\n\\nThis is my Switch port of Julius, a Caesar III re-implementation, based on devnoname120's Vita port.\\n\\nJulius is an open source re-implementation of Caesar III.\\n\\nThe aim of this project is to create an open-source version of Caesar 3, with the same logic as the original, but with some UI enhancements, that is able to be played on multiple platforms. The same logic means that the saved games are 100% compatible, and any gameplay bugs present in the original Caesar 3 game will also be present in Julius.\\n\\nJulius requires the original assets (graphics, sounds, etc) from Caesar 3 to run.\\n\\nInstallation Instructions\\nCopy all the files from a Caesar 3 install into the switch/julius folder on you SD card, so that you have the file c3.eng and more in your folder, in addition to julius.nro. Caesar 3 can be purchased from gog.com for example."
