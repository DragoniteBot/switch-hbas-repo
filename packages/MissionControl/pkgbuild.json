    "changelog": "0.13.0\\nThis release brings full support for firmware 20.0.0 and 20.0.1, an implementation of a new quaternion based motion format found in newer controller firmwares (thanks @Banz99) along with various other bugfixes and improvements.\\n\\nFull changelog:\\nAdded full support for 20.0.X firmwares\\nAdded implementation of new quaternion based motion data format.\\nAdded exefs patches for hid to modify supported feature flags for third-party Licensed Pro Controllers. Button remapping, analog stick and motion calibration are now enabled.\\nChanged emulated controller type to Licensed Pro Controller. This prevents the console from attempting to read NFC data from emulated controllers which was causing freezing and screeching audio in some games.\\nSysmodule no longer initialises btm/btm:sys services on startup in order to leave sessions available to other homebrew applications.\\nAdded a mechanism via bluetooth exefs patches for implementing custom commands called via the WriteHidData2 IPC function. This allows exposing internal bluetooth stack functions.\\nAdded IPC commands to the mc service to expose calls for sending arbitrary HCI commands and calling the internal BSA_DmSetConfig function.\\nAdded a mechanism for external software making use of hid report event redirection to either consume redirected events or forward them back to the system.",
