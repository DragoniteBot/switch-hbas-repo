        "details": "PPSSPP Standalone Switch by m4xw\\n============================================\\n\\nThis is the first Standalone Release for PPSSPP.\\nIt's based on my libretro port with some few distinctions:\\n-JIT improvements (should now work on all Horizon version), masking is no longer required, thus JIT masking bugs are a thing of the past (will be backported to the libretro ver. this week).\\n-All config files reside in /switch/ppsspp/, the path can not be changed for the time being.\\n-You can copy your PPSSPP files from /retroarch/cores/savefiles/PPSSPP/ (savefiles are compatible, savestates are NOT, however I will add a export option to the Core soon-ish).\\n\\nNote:\\n\\n-Due to a toolchain Issue, starting like 15~ games in a row might lead to a crash, your mileage might vary depending of the number of JIT buffer allocations\\n\\nNotes\\n============================================\\n-If you are using ANY method of loading PPSSPP OTHER than Atmosphere's title redirection feature, DO NOT report issues that you encounter.\\n-Don't use NSP's.\\n-After upstreaming, this port will likely become the official\\n\\nSupport\\n============================================\\nSpecial thanks to hrydgard for everything he has done for the PPSSPP Project.\\n\\nIf you want to support his work, consider buying PPSSPP Gold https://central.ppsspp.org/buygold even if you don't use it!\\n\\nMy Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/m4xwdev\\n\\nLinks\\n============================================\\nSwitch Port Github: https://github.com/m4xw/ppsspp/\\nUpstream Github: https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp"
