        "details": "A Pico-8 emulator for the switch.\\n\\nStatus: Not finished - Compatibility is still limited, but there are many cartridges it can run already.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Play many of the pico-8 cartridges (compatibility limited, works best with old ones)\\n- Play with some pre-bundled cartridges, or add your own in /data/p8-cartridges\\n- Load cartridges directly from Lexaloffle's BBS \"featured\" and \"new\" lists.\\n- Save states (at the moment simplistic, one save state per cartridge).\\n- Sound effects and music implemented.\\n\\nProject developed freely by a pico-8 fan. Although it uses Lexaloffle's Pico-8 cartridges, this is not endorsed in any way by them or any of the original cartridge creators."
