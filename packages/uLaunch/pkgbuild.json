        "details": "Custom, open-source replacement/reimplementation for Nintendo Switch's HOME menu (qlaunch), extending it with amazing, homebrew-oriented functionality!\\n\\nuLaunch is a very ambitious project, consisting on two custom library applets, a custom system application and a custom system applet, in order to replace the console's HOME menu with a custom, homebrew-oriented one.\\n\\nThis isn't any kind of HOME menu extension, injection, patch, etc. uLaunch is a complete reimplementation, 100% open-source, which also takes over eShop and Parental control applets and flog system title (all of them are pretty much useless with this reimpl) for its extended functionality.\\n\\nThe project is licensed as GPLv2.\\n\\nFor those who are interested in how the UI was done, this project is, like Goldleaf, a good example of how powerful Plutonium libraries can be in order to make beautiful UIs.\\n\\nFeatures\\nList of HOME menu features uLaunch has:\\n\\nProper launching and foreground management: launch, suspend and close titles and applets\\n\\nProper general channel handling (some of it might be not implemented): sleep, shutdown, reboot, HOME menu press detection...\\n\\nSettings:\\n\\nShow connected WiFi network's name\\n\\nOpen connection applet in case user wants to change network settings\\n\\nChange console's language and show active one\\n\\nChange console's nickname and show current one\\n\\nUser features:\\n\\nAllow creating user on the startup menu\\n\\nShow user's page (in order to edit nickname, icon, friends...)\\n\\nHomebrew support\\n\\nLaunching as applets (no need of Album!)\\n\\nLaunching as applications (no need of any titles to do so!)\\n\\nCustom basic homebrew menu\\n\\nOption to add custom NRO accessors to main menu (homebrew or custom items easily accessible, no more need of forwarders!)\\n\\nUI\\n\\nThemes (different to official HOME menu themes/NXThemes)\\n\\nCustom icons, menu assets and graphics (custom images, colors, sizes, positions...), background...\\n\\nCustom background music and sound effects!\\n\\nFolders in order to keep your main menu organized!\\n\\nUsers\\n\\nPC-like login on startup (select user and use it for everything, log off, register/change/remove password...)\\n\\nUser password support! (up to 15 characters)\\n\\nMiscellaneous extras\\n\\nWeb browsing (via web-applet) directly from the main menu!\\n\\nConsole screen capturing from PC itself (Windows-only) via USB-C cable and uViewer tool!\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nHomebrew-as-application 'flog' takeover\\nuLaunch allows you to launch homebrew as an application, taking advantage of the system's 'flog' built-in application title, which was stubbed but not removed, thus it's content can be overriden via LayeredFS and launched.\\n\\nSince launching this title should be impossible, it might involve ban risk. uLaunch has this option disabled by default, so enable and use it use it at your own risk. Always make youre you're safe from bans (by using tools like 90DNS) before using uLaunch to avoid any possible risks."

    "changelog": "1.2.1\\nSome changes/fixes below are still experimental (particularly for users with a lot of games installed), so please report any weird/new issues you find!\\nRecompiled with Atmosph√®re v1.9.1 support (20.1.0)\\n\\nIntroduced a new game icon/NACP caching system to circumvent issues with 20.x icon/NACP loading slowdowns:\\n\\n- Icon/NACP data is stored in-memory in uSystem, which is why uSystem's memory footprint increases from 12MB to around 40MB: this should, in theory, allow cache for up to 200 installed games. If anyone happens to have more than this amount installed, then (even though this is already an absurd amount) feel free to open an issue to request more cache memory (we could theoretically use up to around 50MB)\\n\\n- Don't worry, since this shouldn't impact anything: we are already using less memory than the base HOME menu (which is around 50MB) even considering the resulting size of the uSystem binary, we have been for years and still are, so (as always) things will be the same as with regular HOME menu, maybe even smoother\\n\\nFixed a bug causing major slowdowns for users with many games (even with around 10 it was noticeable), also related to 20.x changes, where a given command was called every frame (for every app) and made uMenu slow down whenever too many games were in view in the main menu (the value is now read just once when the apps are loaded)\\n\\nFixed a dumb bug where uMenu would only try to cache the active theme if it was not cached yet... while uSystem was wiping ALL cache every reboot, thus the theme was being cached every boot\\n\\nFixed a weird bug where (sometimes?) the default theme would be considered outdated",
