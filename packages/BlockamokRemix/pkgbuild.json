    "changelog": "v1.1\\nMajor performance improvements and others, make sure you update!\\n\\nTechnical Improvements:\\n -Significantly optimized rendering and block logic. This means higher framerates on all systems (sometimes much higher)!\\n- The goal was usually to reach 60 FPS on the most intense settings while maintaining good block spawn boundaries, though some consoles only reach this target on less intense difficulties.\\n- Increased cube spawn boundaries on almost all consoles to take advantage of improved performance.\\nOther minor optimizations and polish.\\n\\nChanges:\\n- Enhanced controller support! Input is now read from all connected controllers, and you can freely connect/disconnect controllers as desired.\\n- Added Block Transparency setting. Disabling this can slightly improve performance if needed.\\n- Added Frame Rate setting, intended for weak hardware.\\n- Made True Analog (formerly called Type B) the default control scheme.\\n- Made Pitch Black the default overlay color.\\n- Renamed and reorganized some menu options.\\n- Added version number to credits."
