You can see how fast this is by loading the gamecard menu as that manually parses everything, and it loads the gamecard faster than the home menu.\\noptimise theme meta loading.\\n[gc menu] tries to load control data from ns cache before manually loading.\\nfix installing failing during setup if prod.keys isn't found. thanks to Marulv for helping with debugging this issue.\\ndon't fail if the control nca cannot be parsed during install, as it may depend on ticket not yet installed.\\n[games menu] add game dumping.\\n[games menu] add usb game transfer (switch 2 switch).\\nadd support for custom upload locations (http, ftp, webdav etc).\\n[games menu] add support for game dumping to custom upload location.\\n[file browser] add support for uploading files / folders to custom upload locations.",
