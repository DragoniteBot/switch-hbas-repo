        "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed.\\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations."

    "changelog": "1.8.7\\nBug fixes for file_source toggles.\\nThere were issues with file_source not being properly resolved with subsequent clicks to file_source toggles.\\nIssues should now be resolved.\\nSorting related bug fixes for command grouping split5.\\nNew method flag for generating empty text files with the name of files/folders within a directory\\nCalled flag <input_path_wildcard_pattern> <output_dir>.\\nMight not be particularly useful in most cases, but it is essential for proper management of active contents mods within Mod Alchemist.\\nTweaks / improvements to dangerous pattern detection.\\nPatterns with multiple * next to each other (i.e. ** or ***, etc) are now considered dangerous and will return a failed command for move and delete.\\nnull* and *null are also considered to be dangerous patterns (failed placeholder replacements).\\nCleanup of failed placeholder replacements to return null instead of empty values when necessary.```\\nScriptOverlay (minus on a command) related bug fixes.\\nSlight corrections to compare as well as split and slice placeholder methods.\\nSlight code optimizations\\n\\n1.8.6\\ndate once every second.\\nNew back command implementation for simulating Back / KEY_B button press.\\nfilter commands now accept wildcard patterns for more advanced filtering of source inputs.\\nNew command grouping (;grouping=) option split5. (similar to split3 except it works on the folder containing the file/folder).\\nSide-note: All command grouping modes will eventually be renamed to avoid confusion.\\nTitle ID placeholders {title_id} now work within source function definitions.\\npxhtxt2ips conversions now create an empty title ID text file within the folder where the IPS mod is generated.\\nThis feature is necessary for proper management of active mods within Mod Alchemist.\\nThe title ID is read from the comments within the .pchtxt file (already necessary for pxhtxt2cheat conversions).\\nAll IPS mods must be regenerated for this file to be generated. Otherwise IPS mods will not register within the Active tabs on Mod Alchemist.\\nVarious menu traversal related bug fixes.\\nVarious bug fixes within libultrahand\\n\\n1.8.5\\nStability Update\\nCritical bug fixes for decimal to hex conversions.\\nUpdates to all devkitpro related libraries.\\n\\n1.8.4\\nStability Update\\n\\nList of changes:\\n\\nVarious bug fixes to isDangerousCombination (dangerous pattern detection). Certain wildcard patterns were being flagged with the old implementation that should not be.\\nThis fixes exeFS Groups's Enable All and Disable All commands in Mod Alchemist.\\nBug fixes for the ScriptOverlay (minus on a command) where ./ placeholders were not being properly replaced with the package folder for commands.\\nVarious logging related bug fixes. (default log is currently set to  sdmc:/switch/.packages/log.txt when logging is enabled)\\nTweaks to decimalToHex implementations in libultra to manually specify byte order (order 2 = XX, order 4 = XXXX, order 6 = XXXXXX, etc). This should resolve problems related to a decimal value of 0. Default order is 2, then will be assumed according to the decimal value if greater.\\nhex-by-custom-decimal-offset <file_path> <custom_pattern> <offset> <decimal_data> [optional_order]\\nhex-by-custom-rdecimal-offset <file_path> <custom_pattern> <offset> <rdecimal_data> [optional_order]\\nhex-by-decimal <file_path> <decimal_data_to_replace> <decimal_data_replacement> [optional_order] [optional_occurrence]\\nhex-by-rdecimal <file_path> <decimal_data_to_replace> <decimal_data_replacement> [optional_order] [optional_occurrence]\\n{decimal_to_hex(decimal, optional_order)} or  {decimal_to_hex(decimal)}\\nSidenote: For usage of optional_occurrence, optional_order must be specified.\\n\\n1.8.3\\nNew toggle option Dynamic Logo in UI Settings > Miscellaneous for enabling / disabling the dynamic logo effect.\\nVarious fixes to libultrahand.\\nLaunch combo is read from the tesla.ini if ultrahand.ini does not exist for overlays compiled with libultrahand. (bug fix)\\nFix for converting pchtxt's with embedded comments as well as a couple other tweaks.\\nSubtle UI corrections / improvements.\\nThe memory indicator on the System page now shows the true memory (no longer -8MB) and has custom coloring.\\nNew theme colors healthy_ram_text_color, neutral_ram_text_color, and bad_ram_text_color.\\nHealthy is >= 9MB.\\nNeutral is < 9MB, >= 3MB.\\nBad is < 3MB.\\nVarious minor tweaks.\\nThe pre-generated package.ini now has symbols on some of the Reboot To commands and the Shutdown command.\\nThe ultra.ini theme that is installed when updating has been updated to use white text color.\\nThe ultra-blue.ini theme that is installed when updating is now the old ultra.ini theme color.",
