        "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed. Includes ppkantorski's nx-ovlloader fork. \\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations."

    "changelog": "v1.10.0\\nList of changes:\\n1. Expansion of the overlay key combo launcher implementation.\\n    - New launch argument modes implementation.\\n        - Users can add launch argument modes to overlay entries in /config/ultrahand/overlays.ini.\\n        - For example, for mini and micro entry points on my Status Monitor fork, users can add mode_args=(-mini, -micro) as well as mode_labels=(Mini, Micro) for labeling them.\\n        - After adding mode_args (or mode_args and mode_labels) new mode options will appear within the overlay settings menu (Y on an overlay).\\n    - All libultrahand compiled overlays (compiled with v1.10.0+) now allow for quick launches.\\n        - This means you can jump from one overlay / overlay mode to another without ever returning to ovlmenu.ovl. \\n    - Pressing the combo used to launch the overlay will now also return users back to ovlmenu.ovl.\\n    - Setting combos will now also instantly be applied (no need to exit the menu).\\n    - You can now also be anywhere within Ultrahand and trigger an instant jump to any overlay / overlay mode using key combos.\\n2. New Launch Combos global toggle in the Miscellaneous settings menu.\\n    - This will disable all overlay launch combos from working.\\n    - Can be useful if you are playing a game that demands lots of button combinations.\\n3. Critical bug fixes for menu navigation.\\n    - The ScriptOverlay was actually still broken in v1.9.10 on certain menus.\\n    - These fixes address a lot of potential mishandling of pointers in main.cpp.\\n4. Unzip commands have been improved and are now less prone to errors.\\n5. Commands in progress will now properly hit 100% instead of going from 99% to complete.\\n6. Cursor center focus has been slightly lowered.\\n    - This prevents slight- scrolling from kicking in after hitting the 4th item on the list.\\n7. Slight re-organization of the Miscellaneous settings menu.\\n8. The overlay / package settings menu now displays the version, with slight formatting improvements.\\n9. Changing the sort priority for overlays / packages now triggers an immediate jump to the item being sorted upon return.\\n10. Various alignment corrections and bug fixes.\\n\\nv1.9.10\\nQuick patch: (stability update)\\n\\nList of changes:\\n1. Restoration of the ScriptOverlay (minus on a command).\\n    - There was a lingering issue within the List class that was causing mis-handlings of the cached items for certain menus upon return.\\n        - This issue should be resolved now.\\n2. Potential memory leak bug fix for aborted unzip/download commands.\\n3. Smoother text scrolling (for list items with long text).\\n4. Slightly improved color sampling for the cursor blink effect.\\n5. Slight optimizations to the handleRunningInterpreter input handler.\\n6. Removal of unused variable declarations in the MainMenu class.\\n7. Slight alignment corrections to the table background.\\n\\nv1.9.9\\nList of changes:\\n1. More widget options have been added to the settings menu.\\n    - New toggle for disabling dynamic temperature colors.\\n    - New toggle for forcing center text alignment (on by default).\\n        - When off, text alignment will be set to the right (like before v1.9.8).\\n    - New toggle for extended backdrop (off by default).\\n        - This is an alternative style choice to the backdrop that some users may prefer.\\n    - Widget menu has also now been broken up into \"Widget Items\" and \"Widget Settings\".\\n    - Widget positioning and alignments have also been corrected.\\n2. Important navigational bug fixes (memory leak fixes).\\n    - Page swapping (including rapid page swapping), list deconstruction, and management of list item cache have been significantly cleaned up to prevent crashes.\\n    - These changes should prevent lingering navigational memory related issues from randomly occurring.\\n3. New theme color configurations.\\n    - temperature_color: color for temperatures on the widget with dynamic colors disabled.\\n    - battery_charging_color: color for the power indicator on the widget with the battery charging.\\n    - battery_low_color: color for the power indicator on the widget when battery is below 20%.\\n    - Propagation of version_text_color to apply to overlay and package versions on the menu (in addition to the Ultrahand / nx-ovlloader version displayed below the logo).\\n4. Improved dynamic logo with higher resolution color sampling (smoother gradient color progression).\\n5. New alpha fix for screenshots taken with Opaque Screenshots set to off.\\n    - This sets the alpha for certain elements to 14, others to 15 to make screenshots with transparency look more accurate.\\n6. Slight changes to default theme.\\n    - Table background has been reset to a darker shade of gray.\\n    - Side-note:- Default theme must be re-applied for changes to occur.\\n7. Various alignment corrections and bug fixes.\\n\\nNotice:- Next version is currently planned to be v1.9.10, so don't get your hopes up for v2.0.0 quite yet.",
