        "details": "A mitm kip modified from fs_mitm.\\n\\nldn_mitm implements LAN connectivity by replacing the system's ldn service.\\n\\nThe original ldn service is only responsible for calling the WiFi service to scan and connect to nearby Switch. ldn_mitm uses the LAN UDP to emulate this scanning process. Therefore ldn_mitm is usually used with switch-lan-play. A configuration tutorial can be found here."
